                Born to a religious Herd of battle hungry Goliaths. Rok was born abnormally large and strong. The shaman of the herd went to thank the gods,but received a vision of a Goliath slaughtering he's own people and destroying everything in sight , what was once seen as a gift, was now seen as a bad omen. Bigger and stronger than the others with no control. It was believed he would be the death of them all. Even as a child, he had now become known as the destroyer, shunned by all and banished at the age 4 by the parents he bearly knew. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Alone with no name and no home, he travelled alone learning and growing strong on he's own.
            Taking the name of the strongest he could find.
            Traveling from town to town, everyone avoided him, all the children he's age treated him like a monster and the adults feared him.
            </p>

            <p>
            Driven out of every town he visited, it became clear the wild was he's only home.
            While travelling climbing a mountain having been starved for days and pushed to the brink of death, the gods would show him no mercy. A giant white bear appeared before him and while fighting for he's life it became obvious this would be he's last battle. Just as the bear was about to strike, a Warhammer fell from the sky and smashed the beast to bits. This was the first gift he had received. 
            </p>

            <p>
            The hammer now named Brick would be he's first and only friend. Together they would grow and have many adventures, slaying beasts and reducing all that would bring them harm to puddles of blood.
            </p>

            <p>
            Once he reached adulthood, it was time to give society another chance. He would join the only place he would be accepted, the military. He didn't know who had joined or what they stood for, but they would use him as a weapon. More pointless battles fought and more blood shed. In one of these many battles, he lost he's only family, Brick was gone and Rok's rage would not end.
            </p>

            <p>
            After two years of being used as a weapon for battles he knew nothing about, he would leave searching for Brick.
            </p>

            <p>
            Now working as a mercenary, he would continue fighting and hope to one day find Brick, the family he lost.
            </p>
